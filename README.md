## Introduction
Welcome to our full stack application allowing delivery drivers and managers to better communicate.

## 1.1 Scenario

The well-known mail-order business RainForestRetail have been expanding a lot recently and they have reached the limit of what their current systems can support.
Our app solves these challenges currently faced by RainForestRetail:
- A single warehouse creates a bottleneck in the delivery system
- The fleet of delivery vehicles is being poorly utilised
- As more employees are added it becomes harder to get an overview of availability and where everyone is working on a given day

The application provides a user-friendly solution that assists managers with distribution centre optimisation, fleet utilisation and workforce management through its real-time communications functionality with drivers and automated workload allocation & tracking features.
